         <h1>Album Timeline</h1>

         <p> 
            The Album Timeline is a playlist of over 1,700 albums arranged chronologically
            by release date spanning from the 1940s up to 2019. 
         </p>

         <img src="images/playlist.PNG" alt="playlist" >

         <p>
            The Spotify playlist contains the first track of each album, which can be used to navigate to the 
            corresponding full album.
         </p>

         <p>
            The albums featured in the timeline represent a wide variety of popular music genres, as 
            well as a few classical pieces and soundtracks. The criteria used for album inclusion were over 
            3000 ratings on Rate Your Music.com and at least a 3.7 out of 5 rating. I also used my own 
            subjective judgement here and there, as well as lists and reccomendations from other sources.
         </p>

         <p>
            I started work on this incarnation of the project in 2018, and finished in 2021. I plan to listen
            to every album on the list starting from the beginning, and have so far made it halfway through 1974.
