         <h1>RPG Manager Project</h1>

         

         <p> 
            RPG Manager was a final project I created in my second C++ class at Sinclair, though I continued working on it the following
            summer. 
         </p>

         <p> 
            The program is a command/menu driven game mastering tool for a home brew tabletop roleplaying game. 
         </p>

         <p>
            It stores character data including skills,
            armor, weapons, and injuries. Characters, skills, weapons, and armors could be created and saved by the user. 
         </p>

         <p>
            It also allows the user to save 
            and resolve encounters, simulating turn order, actions, and dice rolls using menu commands.
         </p>

         <p>
            The project has been abandoned, but the code can be found at my <a href="https://github.com/Marcvs99/RPG-Manager.git">GitHub</a>.

        <h1>My C++ Experience</h1>

         <p>
            I have had two semesters of basic C++ at Sinclair Community College. It was my first ever programming language,
            and I greatly enjoyed using it and learned a lot. 
         </p>

         <p>
            Many of my C++ projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/Marcvs99">GitHub</a>.
